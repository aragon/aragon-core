# Aragon Core <img align="right" src="https://github.com/aragonone/issues/blob/master/logo.png" height="80px" /> [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aragon/aragon-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aragon/aragon-core)[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/aragon/aragon-core/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/aragon/aragon-core?branch=master)

#### ðŸš¨ Everything in this repo is highly experimental software.
It is not secure to use any of this code in production (mainnet) until proper security audits have been conducted. It can result in irreversible loss of funds.

#### ðŸ¦‹ We are using [CommitETH](http://commiteth.com) to reward open source contributions outside the Aragon Core team.
All issues tagged with **[bounty](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-core/labels/bounty)** are eligible for a bounty on a succesfully merged Pull Request that solves the issue. Even if the bounty says 0 ETH, if it has the **bounty** label, it is higher than 0 ETH (until we automate it, we may take a bit to fund the bounties manually).

Open source is awesome, but it is also hard work that needs to be rewarded to ensure top quality work, and that everyone in the world gets a fair chance to do it.

#### ðŸ‘‹ We are tagging tasks that are [beginner friendly](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-core/labels/beginner-friendly) so you can get started contributing to Aragon Core.
Don't be shy to contribute even the smallest tweak. Everyone will be specially nice and helpful to beginners to help you get started!

### Architecture

![](rsc/architecture.jpg)

### Refactor state

The [master](../../tree/master) branch of this repo is the ongoing refactor to the new, more modular architecture. Even though it compiles, it is currently not possible to run a full DAO using this branch.

The version of the contracts that are ran in the latest release of the [Aragon dApp](../../../aragon-dapp) lives in the [monolith](../../tree/monolith) branch.

This refactor will be released with Aragon v0.4.

A vague representation of the state of the refactor can be found here:

#### Kernel

- [x] Vanilla ETH transactions
- [x] Presigned ETH transactions
- [x] ERC223 token receiver
- [x] Human Token approveAndCall receiver

#### Organs

- [x] Dispatcher organ
- [x] Meta organ
- [ ] Token vault organ
- [x] Governance tokens organ
- [x] Applications organ

#### Apps

- [ ] Bylaws (yet to be connected to Governance app)
- [Â ] Governance (adapt former VotingLib)
- [ ] Capital (yet to be connected to MiniMe logic)
- [x] Roles
- [ ] Accounting and transactions (multi-token)

#### Misc
- [ ] Transition own Governance Token logic and use MiniMe
- [ ] Vote delegation with MiniMe
- [Â ] Default bylaw installation for all apps and DAOs
- [ ] Update DApp to new event names and sources
- [Â ] Update org factory to configure basic DAO
