# Contributing to aragonOS

:tada: Thank you for being interested in contributing to AragonOS! :tada: 

Feel welcome and read the following sections in order to know how to ask questions and how to work on something.

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the project.

All members of our community are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://wiki.aragon.org/documentation/Code_of_Conduct/). Please make sure you are welcoming and friendly in all of our spaces.

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to aragonOS? 
You can start with a [Good First Issue](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) 

> Good first issues are usually for a few lines of code, a test or two, spelling / grammar fixes, typo correction, white space, formatting changes or comment clean up.

Start small, pick a subject you care about, that you are familiar with, or you want to learn.

Here are a couple of friendly tutorials: [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/) and [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## How to file an issue

If you see a problem, you can simply report it in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/issues).
Please take a quick look to see if the issue doesn't already exist before filing yours.

Do your best to include as many details as needed in order for someone else to fix the problem and resolve the issue.

Make sure to answer these five questions:

 1. What version of aragonOS are you using?
 2. What operating system are you using?
 3. What did you do?
 4. What did you expect to see?
 5. What did you see instead?
 
## How to report a bug

#### If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email security@aragon.org instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

* Can I access or steal something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us.

#### Learn more about our [bug bounty program](https://wiki.aragon.org/dev/bug_bounty/) for rewarding hackers who find security vulnerabilities

## How to fix an issue

01. [Find an issue](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/issues) that you are interested in.
02. Fork the repository to your local GitHub. You will have a copy of the repository under ```your-GitHub-username/aragonOS```.
03. Clone the repository to your local machine using ```git clone https://github.com/github-username/aragonOS.git```.
04. Follow the instructions in the [readme](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/blob/master/readme.md) file to run the project locally.
05. Create a new branch for your fix using ```git checkout -b branch-name-here```.
06. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.
07. Use ```git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here``` to add the file contents of the changed files to the "snapshot" git uses to manage the state of the project, also known as the index.
08. Use ```git commit -m "Insert a short message of the changes made here"``` to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message.
09. Push the changes to the remote repository using ```git push origin branch-name-here```.
10. Submit a pull request in github to the upstream repository.
11. Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. For example, you can use a title like "Added more log outputting to resolve #4352".
12. In the pull request description, explain the changes that you made and add any questions you have for the maintainer.
13. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.
14. Make changes to the pull request if the maintainer recommends them.
15. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged!

It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is). 
The reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!


You can also edit a page directly through your browser by clicking the "EDIT" link in the top-right corner of any page and then clicking the pencil icon in the github copy of the page.
