# Vault

Vaults own and manage the ERC20 assets the DAO has.

The design rationale for having Vaults instead of allowing:

- Allowing the installation of third party apps that can spend from the same pool of assets as other apps.
- Being able to revoke spending permissions to apps without having to move assets.
